OSPF management software application

The purpose of the application is to reconstruct the topology of a given network using information, particularly the OSPF database, stored in a specific router within the network.


IMPORTANT: for the test you have to create the bridge, the .eapi.conf file in your home directory used by containerlab to deploy the network and activate a venv virtual environment

bridge manual creation:
> sudo ip link add SW type bridge
> sudo ip link set SW up
> ip link show SW

.eapi.conf:
